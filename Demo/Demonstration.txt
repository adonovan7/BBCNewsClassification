\cf0 A popular mobile gaming app is making headlines in Turkey after its founder was accused by players of defrauding them of their investments.\
Turkish media claimed Mehmet Aydin, the 26-year-old founder of the Farm Bank game (Ciftlik Bank in Turkish), has fled the country, with tens of thousands of people who invested in the game out of pocket.\
He and his business partners came up with the game in 2016, inspired by popular social media game FarmVille. Users would buy virtual animals and farming equipment with real money.\
Mr Aydin promised users their money would be invested in real livestock in different farms across the country. Products were also put up sale in some stores and show-farms to woo investors.\
Users would be paid for time spent playing the game.\
The story has gripped the nation with more than 100,000 Twitter users discussing Mr Aydin and his scheme since Monday.\

Analysts estimated about 80,000 people have invested their money into the game. According to Ahval News, the project raised more than $120m (\'a385m) and paid out about $100m to 62,877 investors.\
According to Turkish media reports, the rest of the money was transferred to Mr Aydin and his wife's personal bank accounts. Mr Aydin sold his shares in the company in December 2017.\
Turkey's financial regulators filed a complaint at the end of 2017 after users complained about broken promises.\
The company said on 9 January that it had suspended accepting new users.\
On 16 January Mr Aydin said investors' money could not be paid back on time as the banks refused to work with his company after the complaints.\
