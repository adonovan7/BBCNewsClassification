Calendar 2 was available via the official Mac App store and gave extra features to anyone who let the mining code run.
But users voiced complaints about the software as bugs in it made their machines run slowly.
There had also been surprise that Apple had allowed the feature to be offered.
The US tech giant has not commented.
Calendar 2's creator has now disabled the code, citing complaints and worries about the "ethics" of mining.
According to the developer Qbix's site, more than 757,000 people use its time-management program - although that figure includes earlier versions of the software that did not include the mining component.
