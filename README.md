# BBC News Classification
Final Project for Spark Programming Class: Classification of BBC News Articles

## Abstract
In this project, we used natural language processing and machine learning techniques to classify online news articles into one of five genres. 
After comparing Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network techniques, we found that all four had very high and comparable
accuracy rates when predicting labels on our test set. In this project, we used natural language processing and machine learning techniques to
